# BlockChain_Simulation
Implementing a blockchain Python application :
- That keeps track of blockchain branches and appends new 
blocks to the longest branch.
- In order to append a block, the block contain a 64bit nonce that causes the hash to start with N zeros.
- Each block should contain a random list of transactions.

# Objectives:
1) Control the puzzle hardness by varying N so that the block chain grows at 1 block per second.
2) Simulate an attack on the blockchain: There is a chance that an attacker appears and tries to grow 
his own branch of the blockchain, by appending to a previous block (not the latest verified block).
The attack speed is a predetermined parameter.
3) By experimentation,find the attack speed where an attack is successful (the main branch is 
replaced with the attackerâ€™s branch), and compare it to the legit blockchain speed.

# Attack Simulation
In this implementation the attacker has about 53% percent of the compute capacity, and the attack may fail in this case or success but in most cases attack will success.

# Requirements 
- The script is written in python 3 so it need to ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75391814/175976928-720ef9cf-ebb2-4648-8f72-a5dc6a268ee3.png)
be installed.
- libraries used : datetime, random, haslib ,json.
